This repository contains MATLAB programs and scripts for practicing and demonstrating fundamental and advanced concepts of Digital Image Processing (DIP).
Digital Image Processing (DIP) is the use of algorithms and mathematical operations to process digital images. This project serves as a collection of DIP techniques implemented using MATLAB, aimed at helping learners and practitioners understand the practical aspects of image processing.
